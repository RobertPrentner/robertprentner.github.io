## Project overview
The project develops a theoretically robust, empirically grounded, and computationally implementable AI framework that *operationalizes access to consciousness via interfaces to reality* rather than as an emergent property of internal information processing. Our approach leverages philosophical reasoning, mathematical phenomenology, applied category theory, and modern AI techniques to create a series of interconnected research projects. These projects will map, model, and implement networks of interacting agents that ground phenomena such as spacetime, agency, self/world-models, and meanings as data structures.

AI consciousness research is a *technology–driven* endeavor. We aim to implement computational methods to design and optimize interfaces that internalize consciousness, akin to exploring potential energy surfaces in quantum chemistry. The research program does not treat AI agents as “containers” of consciousness but as experimental constructors of interfaces for engagement with reality. Subprojects provide concrete, testable implementations, simulations, and formal analyses, all informed by foundational philosophical commitments and designed for interdisciplinary collaboration and impact.
